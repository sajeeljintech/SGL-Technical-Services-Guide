# Outdoor Cabling

## Reduce Risk

All installations of cabling and newwork hardware should be done to mitigate risks.  Risks are all the things that can cause your installation to be unreliable, fail or be damaged inadvertantly.

This is a list of the top risks to consider in planning an installing network hardware.

#### Location

Each location is unique.  If you need to install cabling or equipment in a specific location (e.g. The ingate structure for a ring), you want to carefully consider how best to do the installation.  The plan for each location should be reviewed with the client to ensure that our assumptions about that location are true.  Here are questions that should be considered and asked if necessary

**Is this location permanant or temporary?**\
Structures that are fixed to the ground can be considered permanant.  Tents, or ingates that are designed to be moved should be considered temporary. &#x20;

Equipment for permanant structures should be installed EITHER inside those structures or immediately adjacent too them.\


_**Adjacent Installations**_

Installations Adjacent to a permanant or permanant structure should have a permanat location to house the network gear and cabling that is&#x20;

* Weather Proof
* Lockable
* Ventilated
* Large enough for current and future equipment (at least some extra space)

A properly installed outdoor weather box will be attached securely to a frame that is made of either corrugated steal or treated lumber (4X4 Posts with, treated plywood board for mounting.). Steal frame and PVC or steel box is preferred

_**Inside Installations**_

if equipment is to be installed inside a structure you must consider if the structure is partially weather proof or entirely weather proof.  If there is a door, windows and a roof and weather can't easily penetrate the interior space then it can be considered weatherproof.  If any portion of the building is open to the weather then it must NOT be considered weatherproof and all equipment must be installed in a manner that will protect it from the weather.

_Weather proof structures_\
You may use a wall mount rack or similar for installation of network gear and cabling when the structure is weather proof. \

_Non-Weather proof structures_

For non-weather proof structures use PVC or Metal enclosure that is fully weather proof.
